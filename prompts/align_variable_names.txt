Clean the relations based on the text provided below. 

Issue:
Relations were extracted from an image accompanying the text, but some variable names (cause, effect, moderator) deviate from the text or contain some ocr errors

Think step-by-step:
Carefully look at each relation from the extractions and clean the variable names. Furthermore look in the document below whether it refers to a variable presented in that document and map it to that name. 

Output structure:
The output should formatted in the same way as the extractions currently are. The json should be indicated by ```json ```

Rules:
- Drop relations that include error terms or indicators that only consist of abbreviations and integer IDs
- Do not modify the beta field 

Image extractions:
<img_extractions>

Document context:
<doc>
